            I functioned in multiple capacities while working in this role. The
            first of these included diagnosing and repairing a variety of mobile
            electronics. These devices included cell phones and tablets running
            both iOS and Android. I strived to perform each repair to the best
            of my ability by using my analytical and problem-solving skills to
            ensure each repair was completed to a high standard of quality and
            reliability. I also served as the company’s primary computer repair
            technician during this time. This meant that I had the opportunity
            to take the same level of work integrity that I had employed fixing
            mobile devices to also service desktop and laptop computers running
            Windows and MacOS. The types of issues that these devices often had
            is more varied and, as such, it became even more valuable to have a
            keen problem-solving sense. This along with my other abilities as an
            organized and detail-oriented person have allowed me to succeed
            beyond expectations in this capacity. Due to my aforementioned
            success, I was also assigned several other tasks for the company.
            Firstly, I was assigned to update pricing information on our company
            website as well as within our internal systems every 3-6 months
            (when new prices were released). This process involved manually
            comparing new data with existing data to ensure that pricing was up
            to date and consistent across all platforms. I was also tasked with
            maintaining and updating internal computer systems across the
            company. My work in this area included resolving specific issues
            brought to my attention by other employees.

            My work for West-MEC consisted of a volunteer project to convert
            their cosmetology program’s record keeping system from an
            inefficient paper-based system to a highly organized electronic
            system. This required the system to be able to receive and store a
            large amount of data from students within the program and allow that
            data to be seen and processed by teachers. Additionally, this
            software had to be easily accessible, secure, and low cost. I was
            able to accomplish all of these tasks and more.

          <ion-card-content class="ion-text-start">
            In this role I worked as the primary editor on promotional video
            materials for the RockHouseU online music education platform. My
            day-to-day work involved editing assigned video footage remotely to
            a high degree of accuracy. The source footage was often shot on
            green screen and using multiple camera angles. This meant that I had
            to sync colors and audio across both sources so that the final
            product looked consistent and professional. Since the primary goal
            of these promotional materials was to demonstrate to prospective
            customers the quality and usability of the platform as a learning
            resource, it was immensely important for each video to reflect the
            quality present on the platform.
