            This site was made to replace a paper and pencil records management
            system for West-MEC's Hairstyling program. It allows students to
            record information about clients and then allows teachers to review
            and grade students based on their records.

            This is a site I developed to aid West-MEC Central Campus's Coding
            program in a multitude of tasks. The site was designed, primarily,
            as a way for students to quickly access information about upcoming
            program and volunteer events. As a secondary function, the site also
            gives info about different classroom personnel as well as FBLA
            program events and competitions.

            I've been using both Illustrator and Photoshop for the last 3-4
            years and I became certified in Illustrator by Adobe about 2 years
            ago to further prove my skills in this area. I have the capabilities
            to design advertising graphics, create clean mockups, create high
            quality renders of images, and so much more thanks to what I've
            learned in the entire Adobe suite over the past few years.

            <strong>From Acclaim:</strong> "The Adobe Certified Associate (ACA)
            certification is the industry-recognized validation of oneâ€™s skill
            in Adobe Illustrator CC. This certification requires in-depth
            knowledge of setting project requirements, understanding the Adobe
            Illustrator CC interface, as well as creating digital graphics and
            illustrations using Adobe Illustrator CC."
