              In addition to my love for writing software, I also have a love
              for photography. I mostly enjoy shooting nature scenes and I try
              to explore new areas at least a few times a month. Not only do I
              like taking pictures but I also enjoy editing them afterwards. I
              enjoy building custom servers and desktop computers which meshes
              in with my love for photo editing perfectly since it allows me to
              better maximize the performance of my machine while I’m editing.

              I’ve been doing web development for about two and a half years and
              in that time, I’ve discovered just how much I enjoy solving
              problems that can positively impact the lives of others. However,
              my pursuits in technology start long before that time. I’ve been
              building custom computers and servers for myself as well as my
              friends and family since I was in middle school. This passion is
              ultimately what led me to the software development (and
              subsequently the web development) world.
